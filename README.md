Static NAT:Maps a single private IP address to a single public IP address. Itâ€™s a one-to-one translation, often used for devices that need to be accessible from the internet, such as servers.
Dynamic NAT:Maps a private IP address to a public IP address from a pool of available public addresses. The translation is not fixed and can change over time.
